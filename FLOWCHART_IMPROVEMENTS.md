# Flowchart Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Complete Step Visibility ✅
**Problem**: Only the first two steps were visible in procedure flowcharts, even when more steps were generated.

**Solution**: 
- Modified the expansion logic in `MindMapContent.tsx` to detect procedure flowcharts automatically
- For procedure flowcharts (containing step nodes), ALL nodes are now expanded by default
- For regular mind maps, only root and category nodes are expanded (preserving original behavior)
- Added detection logic based on node metadata types (`decision_step`, `regular_step`, `terminal_step`) and step IDs

**Code Changes**:
- Updated initialization logic in `src/components/mindmap/MindMapContent.tsx`
- Added automatic procedure detection
- Enhanced console logging for debugging

### 2. Complete Decision Options Display ✅
**Problem**: Decision nodes only showed the first 3 options with "+X more..." text.

**Solution**:
- Removed the `slice(0, 3)` limitation in `MindMapNode.tsx`
- Added scrollable container for many options (`max-h-32 overflow-y-auto`)
- Enhanced display to show both option labels and descriptions
- Improved spacing and readability

**Code Changes**:
- Updated `src/components/MindMapNode.tsx` decision options rendering
- Enhanced option display with better formatting
- Added scrolling for nodes with many decision options

### 3. Enhanced Metadata Display ✅
**Problem**: Metadata was displayed as raw JSON, making it hard to read.

**Solution**:
- Completely redesigned metadata display in `ContentView.tsx`
- Added structured sections: Title, Description, Node Type, Decision Options, Technical Metadata
- Smart data type rendering:
  - Booleans as Yes/No badges
  - Arrays as bulleted lists
  - Objects with proper hierarchy
  - Null/undefined as "Not set"
- Added icons for different metadata types
- Visual indicators for decision points and terminal steps

**Code Changes**:
- Major rewrite of `src/components/ContentView.tsx`
- Added helper functions for metadata rendering
- Enhanced UI with proper spacing and visual hierarchy

### 4. Thinner Edge Lines ✅
**Problem**: Lines between nodes were too thick, making the flowchart look cluttered.

**Solution**:
- Reduced stroke width for regular edges from 1.5 to 1
- Reduced stroke width for decision edges from 2 to 1.5
- Updated CSS hover and selected states to use thinner lines (2 instead of 3)
- Added default edge path styling to ensure consistent thin lines

**Code Changes**:
- Updated `src/components/mindmap/nodeUtils.ts` edge processing
- Modified `src/components/ReactFlowChart.css` edge styling
- Improved visual hierarchy while maintaining readability

### 5. Better Initial Zoom and Positioning ✅
**Problem**: Flowcharts didn't focus on the beginning/start of the procedure when first loaded.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced initial positioning to detect procedure flowcharts automatically
- For procedure flowcharts: Focus on the first/root node with 0.8 zoom level
- Improved fitView options with better padding and zoom constraints
- Increased default viewport zoom from 0.6 to 0.75
- Added smart centering on the starting nodes of procedures

**Code Changes**:
- Updated `src/components/mindmap/MindMapContent.tsx` initialization logic
- Enhanced onInit callback to provide procedure-specific positioning
- Improved fitView options for better initial display
- Added root node detection and smart centering

## Benefits

1. **Better Visual Hierarchy**: Thinner lines reduce visual clutter while maintaining clarity
2. **Improved User Experience**: Users immediately see the start of procedures without manual navigation
3. **Enhanced Readability**: Better zoom levels and positioning make flowcharts easier to follow
4. **Consistent Behavior**: Automatic detection ensures appropriate display for different content types
5. **Professional Appearance**: Cleaner lines and better spacing create a more polished look

## Test Data
Created comprehensive test file `test-procedure.yaml` with:
- 24 sequential steps
- Multiple decision points (4-5 options each)
- Rich descriptions and metadata
- All node types (regular, decision, terminal)

## Technical Details

### Automatic Procedure Detection
The system now automatically detects procedure flowcharts by checking for:
- Metadata types: `decision_step`, `regular_step`, `terminal_step`
- Node IDs starting with `step_`

### Smart Expansion Logic
- **Procedures**: All nodes expanded → Complete workflow visibility
- **Mind Maps**: Root + category nodes only → Hierarchical exploration

### Enhanced Data Handling
- Preserves all original node data during edits
- Smart content structure updates
- Maintains decision options and metadata integrity

### Edge Styling
- Regular edges: 1px stroke width
- Decision edges: 1.5px stroke width  
- Hover state: 2px stroke width
- Selected state: 2px stroke width

### Initial Positioning
- Procedure detection based on node metadata and IDs
- Root node identification using edge analysis
- Smart centering with 0.8 zoom for procedures
- Fallback to standard fit view for mind maps

### Zoom Levels
- Default viewport: 0.75 zoom
- Procedure focus: 0.8 zoom
- FitView range: 0.6 to 1.5 zoom
- Min zoom: 0.05, Max zoom: 2.0

## Usage
1. Load any procedure YAML file
2. All steps will be visible immediately (no manual expansion needed)
3. Click any node to see detailed, formatted metadata
4. Click "Edit Node" to modify title and description
5. Decision options show all choices with descriptions
6. Visual indicators clearly distinguish node types

## Browser Console
Enhanced logging shows:
- Procedure detection status
- Node expansion decisions
- Visibility calculations
- Edit mode transitions
