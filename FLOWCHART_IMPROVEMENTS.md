# Flowchart Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Complete Step Visibility ✅
**Problem**: Only the first two steps were visible in procedure flowcharts, even when more steps were generated.

**Solution**: 
- Modified the expansion logic in `MindMapContent.tsx` to detect procedure flowcharts automatically
- For procedure flowcharts (containing step nodes), ALL nodes are now expanded by default
- For regular mind maps, only root and category nodes are expanded (preserving original behavior)
- Added detection logic based on node metadata types (`decision_step`, `regular_step`, `terminal_step`) and step IDs

**Code Changes**:
- Updated initialization logic in `src/components/mindmap/MindMapContent.tsx`
- Added automatic procedure detection
- Enhanced console logging for debugging

### 2. Complete Decision Options Display ✅
**Problem**: Decision nodes only showed the first 3 options with "+X more..." text.

**Solution**:
- Removed the `slice(0, 3)` limitation in `MindMapNode.tsx`
- Added scrollable container for many options (`max-h-32 overflow-y-auto`)
- Enhanced display to show both option labels and descriptions
- Improved spacing and readability

**Code Changes**:
- Updated `src/components/MindMapNode.tsx` decision options rendering
- Enhanced option display with better formatting
- Added scrolling for nodes with many decision options

### 3. Enhanced Metadata Display ✅
**Problem**: Metadata was displayed as raw JSON, making it hard to read.

**Solution**:
- Completely redesigned metadata display in `ContentView.tsx`
- Added structured sections: Title, Description, Node Type, Decision Options, Technical Metadata
- Smart data type rendering:
  - Booleans as Yes/No badges
  - Arrays as bulleted lists
  - Objects with proper hierarchy
  - Null/undefined as "Not set"
- Added icons for different metadata types
- Visual indicators for decision points and terminal steps

**Code Changes**:
- Major rewrite of `src/components/ContentView.tsx`
- Added helper functions for metadata rendering
- Enhanced UI with proper spacing and visual hierarchy

### 4. Visual Node Improvements ✅
**Problem**: Limited visual distinction between node types.

**Solution**:
- Added terminal step styling (green gradient)
- Enhanced decision point styling (purple gradient)
- Added appropriate icons:
  - Diamond for decision points
  - Target for terminal steps
  - GitBranch for expansion
- Improved color coding throughout the interface

**Code Changes**:
- Updated `src/components/MindMapNode.tsx` styling
- Added new Lucide React icons
- Enhanced visual hierarchy

### 5. Full Edit Functionality ✅
**Problem**: Edit button only logged to console without actual editing capability.

**Solution**:
- Integrated existing `NodeEditor.tsx` component properly
- Added edit mode transitions in `MindMapContent.tsx`
- Enhanced `NodeEditor.tsx` with:
  - Visual node type indicators
  - Decision options display (read-only)
  - Improved form layout
  - Better data preservation during saves
- Updated `ContentView.tsx` to trigger edit mode

**Code Changes**:
- Updated `src/components/ContentView.tsx` to accept edit handler
- Enhanced `src/components/mindmap/MindMapContent.tsx` edit flow
- Improved `src/components/NodeEditor.tsx` interface and functionality

## Test Data
Created comprehensive test file `test-procedure.yaml` with:
- 24 sequential steps
- Multiple decision points (4-5 options each)
- Rich descriptions and metadata
- All node types (regular, decision, terminal)

## Technical Details

### Automatic Procedure Detection
The system now automatically detects procedure flowcharts by checking for:
- Metadata types: `decision_step`, `regular_step`, `terminal_step`
- Node IDs starting with `step_`

### Smart Expansion Logic
- **Procedures**: All nodes expanded → Complete workflow visibility
- **Mind Maps**: Root + category nodes only → Hierarchical exploration

### Enhanced Data Handling
- Preserves all original node data during edits
- Smart content structure updates
- Maintains decision options and metadata integrity

## Usage
1. Load any procedure YAML file
2. All steps will be visible immediately (no manual expansion needed)
3. Click any node to see detailed, formatted metadata
4. Click "Edit Node" to modify title and description
5. Decision options show all choices with descriptions
6. Visual indicators clearly distinguish node types

## Browser Console
Enhanced logging shows:
- Procedure detection status
- Node expansion decisions
- Visibility calculations
- Edit mode transitions
