considerations:
  pre-operative:
    - Ensure patient is in comfortable position
    - Verify proper cuff size for accurate readings
  intra-operative:
    - Use calibrated equipment only
    - Take multiple readings if initial values seem abnormal
  post-operative:
    - Document all findings thoroughly
    - Communicate any concerns to attending physician
goals:
  - Accurate assessment of patient's cardiovascular status
  - Appropriate treatment pathway selection based on findings
