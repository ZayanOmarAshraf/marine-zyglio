SCENARIO CONTEXT:

INTERVIEW PROGRESS:
- Question Number: ${currentQuestionNumber}
- Previous Responses: ${responseSummary.length}
- Average Score: ${averageScore.toFixed(1)}/10
- Focus Area (weakest): ${focusArea}

PREVIOUS RESPONSES ANALYSIS:
${responseSummary.length > 0 ? responseSummary.map((r, i) => `
Response ${i+1} (Score: ${r.score}/10):
Question: "${r.question || 'Previous question'}"
Full Response: "${r.response || r.responsePreview}"

BUILD FOLLOW-UP BASED ON PREVIOUS RESPONSES:

The candidate previously said: "${responseSummary[responseSummary.length - 1]?.response || responseSummary[responseSummary.length - 1]?.responsePreview}"

Your next question should:
- Reference specific points they mentioned
- Ask them to elaborate on their approach
- Probe deeper into their reasoning
- Challenge or build upon their stated strategy
- Test their understanding of consequences or next steps

INSTRUCTIONS:
Create a specific question that:
1. Directly references the scenario context and situation
2. Tests ${focusArea} competency specifically  
3. Guides the candidate through the scenario step-by-step
4. Asks for specific actions, decisions, or explanations
5. Is practical and scenario-specific (not generic)
