## Scoring System

### Scoring Dimensions (Total: 10 points)

1. **Content Accuracy** (0-4 points)
   - Correctness of information
   - Relevance to question
   - Depth of knowledge demonstrated

2. **Communication Clarity** (0-3 points)
   - Response structure
   - Clarity of expression
   - Logical flow

3. **Engagement Quality** (0-2 points)
   - Thoughtful responses
   - Depth of engagement
   - Quality of interaction

4. **Speaking Fluency** (0-1 point)
   - Natural delivery
   - Confidence level
   - Speaking time optimization

### Progress Calculation

The system calculates progress based on:
- Number of conversation exchanges
- User response quality
- Speaking time and engagement
- Question-answer pairs completed

## Usage

### Basic Implementation

```tsx
import { EnhancedVoiceCertificationWrapper } from '@/components/training/certification/enhanced-voice-certification-wrapper';

function CertificationPage() {
  const handleComplete = (results) => {
    console.log('Certification completed:', results);
  };

  return (
    <EnhancedVoiceCertificationWrapper
      moduleId="your-module-id"
      userId="user-id"
      onCertificationComplete={handleComplete}
    />
  );
}
```

### Drop-in Replacement

The enhanced system is designed as a drop-in replacement for the existing voice certification:

```tsx
// Old implementation
import { ElevenLabsVoiceCertification } from './elevenlabs-voice-certification';

// New implementation (automatic)
import { VoiceCertificationSession } from './voice-certification-session';
```

## Configuration

### Agent Configuration

Update your ElevenLabs agent ID in the enhanced component:

```tsx
// In enhanced-voice-certification.tsx
await conversationSdk.startSession({
  agentId: 'your-actual-agent-id' // Replace with your agent ID
});
```

### Scoring Thresholds

Adjust passing thresholds in the scoring API:

```typescript
// In enhanced-score/route.ts
const passingThreshold = 70; // Default passing score
const shouldContinue = responses.length < 8 && overallScore < 90;
```

## Analytics Events

The system logs comprehensive analytics:

- `TRANSCRIPT_UPDATE`: Real-time transcript changes
- `RESPONSE_SCORED`: Individual response scoring
- `CERTIFICATION_ACHIEVED`: Successful completion
- `CERTIFICATION_FAILED`: Failed attempts

## Database Schema

### Enhanced Certification Data

The `voiceInterviewData` field in the Certification model now includes:

```json
{
  "sessionId": "cert-module-1234567890",
  "conversationHistory": [...],
  "progressMetrics": {
    "totalExchanges": 12,
    "userResponses": 6,
    "agentQuestions": 6,
    "totalUserWords": 150,
    "avgResponseLength": 25.0,
    "totalSpeakingTime": 180,
    "estimatedProgress": 75,
    "estimatedScore": 82
  },
  "responses": [...],
  "scoringMetrics": {
    "totalResponses": 6,
    "averageScore": 8.2,
    "averageSpeakingTime": 30,
    "averageResponseLength": 25
  }
}
```

## Performance Considerations

### Real-time Updates
- Transcript updates are debounced to prevent excessive API calls
- Progress calculations are optimized for smooth UI updates
- Scoring requests are queued to prevent overwhelming the AI service

### Database Optimization
- Analytics events are logged asynchronously
- Large conversation histories are stored efficiently
- Indexes are optimized for session-based queries

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Transcript Not Updating**
   - Check microphone permissions
   - Verify session ID generation
   - Ensure API endpoints are accessible

2. **Scoring Not Working**
   - Verify DeepSeek API configuration
   - Check conversation history format
   - Ensure proper authentication

3. **Progress Bar Stuck**
   - Clear browser cache
   - Check for JavaScript errors
   - Verify real-time connection status

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting:

```typescript
console.log('ðŸŽ¯ Enhanced Voice Certification Debug Mode');
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Voice Emotion Analysis**: Detect confidence and engagement levels
- **Adaptive Difficulty**: Dynamic question difficulty based on performance
- **Multi-language Support**: Internationalization for different languages
- **Advanced Analytics**: Detailed performance insights and trends
- **Integration APIs**: Connect with external learning management systems
